# RipThreat

A World of Warcraft addon that helps tanks track threat loss and taunts in raid environments. For when "I've got aggro" becomes "Had aggro."

## Features

- **Threat Loss Alerts**: Instantly notifies you when you lose threat on a raid boss
- **Taunt Tracking**: Shows who taunted the boss and with what ability
- **History Window**: Keeps track of recent taunts with timestamps (perfect for those "who taunted?" moments)
- **Customizable Alerts**: 
  - Choose your preferred fonts and sounds
  - Customize alert text
  - Adjust font sizes and positions
  - Preview sounds directly in the settings

## Usage

### Basic Commands
- `/rt` or `/ripthreat` - Shows available commands
- `/rt config` - Opens the configuration panel
- `/rt test` - Toggles test mode to try out alerts (safely)

### Configuration
Access the settings through:
1. Game Menu → Interface → AddOns → RipThreat
2. Or type `/rt config`

## Requirements

- Ace3
- LibSharedMedia-3.0 (optional, but recommended for custom fonts and sounds)

## Support
